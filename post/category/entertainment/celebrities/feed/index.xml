<p>Ryan Reynolds&nbsp;teams up with&nbsp;<em>Free Guy</em>&nbsp;director Shawn Levy for his next sci-fi action&nbsp;Netflix&nbsp;film.</p>



<p>Netflix has revealed the teaser for Reynolds&#8217; time-traveling movie, in which his older self travels back to his younger self to assist him to save the world. Netflix’s synopsis of&nbsp;<em>The Adam Project</em>&nbsp;states that Adam Reed, played by Reynolds, “accidentally crash-landing in 2022,” enlists his 12-year-old self on a world-saving mission. The action-packed trailer features Jennifer Garner as Adam&#8217;s mother and Mark Ruffalo as his father.</p>



<p>The series follows 2050 Adam to help him repair his crash-landed ship. Reynolds told&nbsp;<em>Vanity Fair</em>, “The humor that Adam uses in the movie echoes certain aspects of my own life, which is that it’s a defense mechanism. It’s a defense mechanism from allowing anything in and trying to deflect. And of course, part of the journey that he’s on is to lower that shield.”</p>



<p>On Netflix on March 11, the Adam Project will premiere.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Following a news story about Billie Eilish stopping a show to assist a fan, Kanye West now wants the 20-year-old singer to apologize to Travis Scott. During a stop for <a href="/functions/billie-eilish-concert-dates-and-tickets-in-2022/">Eilish&#8217;s Happier Than Ever World Tour,</a> an instance occurred at Atlanta&#8217;s State Farm Arena. The performance was momentarily halted for a fan in need of an inhaler, and the artist stated, &#8220;I wait for the people to be okay before I keep going.&#8221;</p>



<p>Soon after, many media sources began reporting on the comment&#8217;s apparent target towards Travis Scott, referencing the Astroworld Festival accident.</p>



<p>Kanye West took to Instagram to post a screenshot of a headline, along with a caption. “COME ON BILLIE WE LOVE YOU PLEASE APOLOGIZE TO TRAV AND TO THE FAMILIES OF THE PEOPLE WHO LOST THEIR LIVES NO ONE INTENDED THIS TO HAPPEN TRAV DIDN’T HAVE ANY IDEA OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING WHEN HE WAS ON STAGE AND WAS VERY HURT BY WHAT HAPPENED.”</p>



<p>Ye went on to reveal that Travis Scott will be with him at&nbsp;Coachella, where the two are headlining, and requested an apology before his performance. “YES TRAV WILL BE WITH ME AT COACHELLA BUT NOW I NEED BILLIE TO APOLOGIZE BEFORE I PERFORM.”</p>



<p>After the comments were made, it was revealed that Billie Eilish did not write them toward Travis. She has since added to Ye&#8217;s Instagram post, stating that she was not directed her words toward him. “Literally never said a thing about Travis. Was just helping a fan.”</p>

<p>Snoop Dogg has acquired the legendary record label Death Row. Snoop has cemented his status as an entertainment legend and hip-hop luminary by broadening his empire while sealing the acquisition of the label that launched him. MNRK Music Group formerly owned Death Row Records. In a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220209006117/en/Entertainment-Icon-Snoop-Dogg-Acquires-Death-Row-Records-Brand-from-Blackstone-Controlled-MNRK-Music-Group" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement</a>, Snoop spoke of the deal saying,</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“I am thrilled and appreciative of the opportunity to acquire the iconic and culturally significant Death Row Records brand, which has immense untapped future value. It feels good to have ownership of the label I was part of at the beginning of my career and as one of the founding members. This is an extremely meaningful moment for me. I would like to personally thank the teams at Blackstone, MNRK and especially David Kestnbaum, who worked collaboratively with me over several months to make this exciting homecoming a reality. I’m looking forward to building the next chapter of Death Row Records.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Suge Knight, Dr. Dre, and other prominent figures in the music industry launched Death Row Records in the early 1990s. Dr. Dre&#8217;s The Chronic and Snoop Dogg&#8217;s Doggystyle are just a few of the history-making hip-hop albums recorded at this facility, which also hosted such classics as Tupac Shakur&#8217;s All Eyez on Me, Dr. Dre&#8217;s The Chronic, and Snoop Dogg&#8217;s own Doggystyle mixtape. However, in 2006, Death Row filed for bankruptcy and went through a succession of owners before being acquired by toy company Hasbro.</p>



<p>This is a significant accomplishment for Snoop Dogg, who lamented in December of last year that he didn&#8217;t get the chance to buy Death Row Records when he had the opportunity. It appears that Snoop has achieved his ambition and attracted the attention of those in the business, with Kanye West praising it as the best example of &#8220;Black Future Month.&#8221;</p>

<p>A makeup artist named gillianisme on TikTok is transforming herself into virtually any celebrity or recognizable character with brushes and shadows. She has transformed herself into the likes of Scarlett Johansson (2017), Scarlet Witch from Avengers Age Of Ultron; Kate Blanchett as Elizabeth I in &#8220;Into The Woods&#8221; &#8211; she even manages to make Anne Hathaway look good.</p>



<p>When people are alarmed by how easy it is to fake anything with digital means, like Photoshop, and despite the fact that nobody can surprise anyone anymore because everyone knows this too. But this makeup artist shows us otherwise; he demonstrates how one could create an incredible false identity using more &#8220;analog&#8221; methods such as brushes for shadowing or mascara.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s enjoy some of the transformations this artist made possible with the strokes of brushes. Scroll down and enjoy!</p>

<p>Do you want to know what celebrities looked like before they got famous? What their life was like and how it led up to stardom. There&#8217;s something intriguing about seeing a photo of a celebrity before they became famous. It&#8217;s like getting a sneak peek behind the curtain, and witnessing their transformation from an ordinary person into someone who is constantly in the public eye. </p>



<p>In this blog post, we&#8217;ve gathered 25 photos of famous people before they became world-renowned celebrities. Some are recognizable, while others look completely different than you would expect. So without further ado, here they are! Scroll down to enjoy.</p>

<div class="wp-block-buzzeditor-list-item"><h3 class="be-list-item-title"><span style="color:;background-color:;border-color:" class="be-list-item-number">1</span> <span style="color:;background-color:;border-color:" class="be-list-item-text">Sean Connery During His Time With The Royal Navy In 1946</span></h3>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/functions/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/25-early-photos-of-celebrities-you-won-t-believe-26.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryPorn/comments/4020jv/sean_connery_during_his_time_with_the_royal_navy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NotchbackKITT</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Have you ever seen a movie and thought, &#8220;Wow, that guy is good-looking.&#8221; only to find out later that it was the same guy who played James Bond? Sean Connery was one of those guys. Way before he got famous playing secret agents and such, he was just another Scottish lad trying to make his way in the world. </p>



<p>His first job was as a milkman in Edinburgh before he joined the Royal Navy at age 16. After 3 years, Sean was discharged on medical grounds. Then he returned to his hometown where there were many different jobs that he could have taken up: lorry driver or construction worker etc. </p>



<p>But it wasn’t until after World War II that cinema audiences became more acquainted with their hero. They loved him because not only did he look good on-screen (perfectly cast), but also took part during production by doing dangerous scenes while doubled understudies who often got themselves into trouble without knowing how close they came.</p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-buzzeditor-list-item"><h3 class="be-list-item-title"><span style="color:;background-color:;border-color:" class="be-list-item-number">2</span> <span style="color:;background-color:;border-color:" class="be-list-item-text">16-Year-Old Angelina Jolie In Circa 1991</span></h3>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/functions/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/25-early-photos-of-celebrities-you-won-t-believe-27.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption><a href="https://imgur.com/a/UZO04" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unknown</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Angelina Jolie is one of the most talented and beautiful women in Hollywood, but it wasn&#8217;t until her breakthrough role as a cyborg that she found success. The movie Cyborg 2 showed off all-new sides to this already fame-worthy actor; gaining attention from major film festivals around Europe for this performance alone. After being passed upon by several other studios due simply because they didn’t think anyone could make an interesting enough character out. </p>



<p>Angelina Jolie went on to star opposite Tom Cruise playing his daughter who falls into computer hackers&#8217; hands while trying to stop themselves from becoming victims themselves &#8211; which leads to some really engaging scenes between these two actors where you can tell both.</p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-buzzeditor-list-item"><h3 class="be-list-item-title"><span style="color:;background-color:;border-color:" class="be-list-item-number">3</span> <span style="color:;background-color:;border-color:" class="be-list-item-text">Christoph Waltz In 1975</span></h3>

<p>Christoph Waltz was never interested in theatre at the beginning. He had always been fascinated by opera and would visit it twice a week when he was ten years old; even though acting classes were required for his major undergraduate course of study (and part-time work), Christoph still found time to take voice lessons as well so that someday maybe… His breakthrough movie role came along after Inglorious Basterds helped launch him into international stardom &#8211; but not without some initial struggles first!</p>

<p>Eminem is a rap artist who was first heard on the song &#8220;Reckless&#8221; by Ice-T and Chris &#8216;The Glove&#8217; Taylor in 1984. He began rapping himself when he was just 14 years old, releasing his album called Infinite back then, but it failed to make any impact whatsoever, with its release date being January 1996; this all changed, though, because Slim Shady adopted an alter ego character named after him (Slim) which gave birth &#8211; through collaboration between Draymond Vexation Records &amp; Interscope records-, finally leading up towards 1999&#8217;s iconic &#8216;Slim shady LP.&#8217;</p>

<p>Lady Gaga started playing piano at 4 years old and studied acting for ten years before she became successful. She didn&#8217;t get any significant roles in auditions, but then a talent scout noticed her performance on stage while studying in New York City nightclubs where they would play songs like &#8220;Just Dance&#8221; by Jean-Melvin Koalya which became one of 2009&#8217;s best selling singles worldwide! Lady Gaga got famous after her debut album The Fame, which included the singles Just Dance and Poker Face.</p>

<p>Bob Marley’s music career started in his early days of playing with friends. After moving to Trenchtown, he met Higgs and Wilson who were successful vocal duos. They helped him learn how to play guitar. They also introduced other local teens into their circle where they became known as The Wailers eventually signing onto an Island Records contract after releasing one single under it &#8220;Simmer Down.&#8221;</p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-buzzeditor-list-item"><h3 class="be-list-item-title"><span style="color:;background-color:;border-color:" class="be-list-item-number">7</span> <span style="color:;background-color:;border-color:" class="be-list-item-text">Christian Bale In 1990</span></h3>

<p>When Christian Bale was just a young lad, he had no idea that one day he would become one of the most famous actors in the world. In fact, if you polled a room full of people and asked them to guess which Hollywood star had worked at a McDonald&#8217;s in his youth, not many would choose Bale. But it&#8217;s true &#8211; before hitting it big in movies like &#8220;American Psycho&#8221; and &#8220;The Dark Knight&#8221;, the superstar spent some time flipping burgers for minimum wage.</p>

<p>Jennifer Aniston&#8217;s early life is an enigma. She attended a Waldorf school, and after being discovered by one of its teachers during their off-Broadway productions in New York City at age 11. She went on to work part-time jobs, including telemarketer or bike messenger, before getting her first regular television role on Molloy, where the show wasn&#8217;t successful. It did not last long due to failures in other roles. Jennifer became famous worldwide when they offered her flat stomach character Rachel Green in Friends.</p>

<p>Jones&#8217;s love for the theatre and football led him to finance his education at Harvard, where he performed in several plays. After graduating from university with a degree in Fine Arts (and not really knowing what field would be most lucrative), Tommy went on working as an actor while still playing some ball too! He got noticed by Hollywood after being nominated for Best Supporting Actor Oscar-worthy performance in 1993 &#8216;The Fugitive&#8217;.</p>

<p>Quentin Tarantino had a diverse career before he made movies. He worked in various industries, including as an usher at the movie theatre and recruiter for aerospace companies during this period when it was popular to be &#8220;a dreamer.&#8221; His first job out of college was working production assistant on films such as True Lies (1994) by David Fincher &#8211; someone who would go onto great success with their unique style that is all theirs. Then came Reservoir Dogs, which launched him into fame not just here but around Europe too. 1994 saw Inglorious Basterds release alongside its director&#8217;s other breathtaking creations like Kill Bill vols 1 &amp; 2.</p>

<p>Clint Eastwood&#8217;s journey to fame and fortune began when he was drafted into the army in Korea. After serving as a swimming instructor, Clint gained international recognition for his role in Sergio Leone’s spaghetti western &#8216;The Man With No Name&#8217; (1964).</p>

<p>Vin Diesel is an actor, producer, and screenwriter who started his career in the theater. He first performed on stage when he was seven years old, playing Dinosaur Door (a play) produced at The New City Theater Company with other kids from around NYC for two months until it closed due to lack of audience support. This would later lead him to write scripts that were successful enough that Steven Spielberg saw one while casting Saving Private Ryan, jaws open!</p>

<p>Katy Perry started singing in church at age 9, and by 13 had her first guitar as a birthday present. She learned how to play songs from different genres including contemporary Christian music on albums released between 2001-2003 before releasing One of The Boys which contained hit singles like &#8220;I Kissed A Girl&#8221; or even hotter concepts such as Hot n Cold.&#8221;</p>

<p>For years, David Harbour was just another actor working on Broadway and in movies. He had some minor roles but nothing that really skyrocketed his career or made him famous- until Stranger Things came along. The show has been a huge hit for Netflix which means lots more opportunities to work as well as getting recognized outside of Hollywood too where it finally feels like everyone knows who this guy is after all these years. With only one big project under his belt before then being mostly anonymous living life off scripts waiting around at auditioning time trying not to fall asleep while watching.</p>

<p>Mark Zuckerberg&#8217;s passion for programming began in middle school when he wrote his first program. His father saw how interested Mark was and hired a teacher to tutor him privately so that they could work together on projects during college time &#8211; one of these being Facebook which initially started at Harvard but quickly spread across universities nationwide before becoming available to everyone.</p>

<p>When Robin Williams was young, he wanted to be a political analyst. However, after realizing the field of study wasn&#8217;t for him and dropping out of college, his interest shifted towards acting. Three years at The College Of Marin in California helped shape not only himself but also established many successful careers later on including Mork &amp; Mindy (1978-1982) which made him famous.</p>

<p>Keanu Reeves had a pretty normal early life. He was born in Beirut, Lebanon in 1964 to parents Patricia and Samuel Reeves. When he was 3 years old, the family moved to Canada. Reeves grew up in Toronto and went to school there. After high school, he attended college for a year but then decided to drop out and pursue acting. So far, his decision has definitely paid off! Reeves has had an extremely successful career as an actor and is now one of the most well-known stars in Hollywood.</p>

<p>Morgan Freeman&#8217;s career as an actor began when he was just 9 years old. He won his first statewide drama competition at 12, and by high school had performed in a radio show while still working on the campus staff of his university’s theater company. </p>



<p>When Morgan returned from military service during World War II (1942-1945), it wasn&#8217;t long before we saw him getting partial scholarships to Jackson State University where he studied Arts &amp; Letters. But then opted out because there were no roles available for Black actors…especially ones who wanted more than just bit parts or student Aid Work. In addition to that, he worked as a dancer and started getting acting jobs. He became famous in the 1970s for his role in the children&#8217;s television series The Electric Company.</p>

<p>Joe Biden is a well-known politician who has served in various positions both domestically and internationally. He became more familiar to the public at large when he joined forces with Barack Obama as vice president on the 2008 election campaign trail, then again from 2009 to 2017 under their administration&#8217;s leadership together where they helped lead America through some very difficult times including but not limited too: The Great Recession; Katrina Devastation (tion); War In Iraq &#8212; and so much else!</p>

<p>Jim Carrey had a very difficult time in his early days, but he persevered because of one thing: comedy. He would often perform on stage or at local clubs around Toronto where people were able to see just what creativity could do for someone who wasn&#8217;t quite famous yet&#8211;that is until season 2 episode 3 (&#8220;The Hot Potato&#8221;) when they showed off this new talent called &#8220;Jimmie C.&#8221;</p>



<p>In Living Color made its television debut during the 1991-1992 autumn months reaching several million homes each weeknight evening via ABC network stations across America including WABC Channel 5 NYC which featured both original episodes 1 and 2.</p>

<p>Susan Sarandon&#8217;s career is an interesting and diverse one. During her college years, the actress supported herself by cutting hair in between working as a switchboard operator for two different companies &#8211; but it wasn&#8217;t long after graduation before she started gaining recognition on stage. </p>



<p>Her first role came when director George trailer cast Susan to play “Spike” alongside Timothy Dalton (who would become famous for playing Bond character James Bond) back during their student days at London Central School Of Films And Television auditioning together under choreographer/founder Ralph Daily. He said &#8220;It was great fun watching them come up with this really bizarre slow waltz&#8221; while they were dancing around trying not to make any noise.</p>

<p>Dinklage realized in his teen years that he really wanted to pursue a career in acting. In 1984, he saw the production of the play True West written by Sam Shepard and it inspired him so much that it determined the direction of his life. Dinklage went to Bennington College and studied drama there. </p>



<p>But at the beginning of his career, Dinklage struggled. He had to work at a data processing company for six years to make ends meet. He wasn&#8217;t getting any work as an actor partially because he refused roles where the focus of the character would be his achondroplasia. But his time to shine came with the 2003 movie The Station Agent, for which he was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award for best actor. And the role that made Dinklage&#8217;s name known worldwide was Tyrion Lannister in the fantasy drama Game of Thrones.</p>

<p>After reading Eugene O&#8217;Neill&#8217;s The Iceman Cometh and watching the performance Tom Hanks decided that he wanted to be an actor. So he enrolled in the theatre program at California State University &#8211; Long Beach where his campus life was chronicled by telenovelas that streamed onto street corners before being recorded for posterity as part of LADOT history books with roots dating back decades ago when Channel 13 broadcasts were still new technology making this city home even more so than now! </p>

<p>Dwayne &#8220;The Rock&#8221; Johnson was once a professional football player, but he pursued an acting career instead. He became one of the world&#8217;s highest-grossing actors after starring in movies and has been nominated for multiple awards during his time as both actor/director alongside other successful projects such these blockbusters; Pain &amp; Gain (2013), San Andreas (2015), Furious 7: The Reward featuring Carter Velvet Uniforms.</p>

<p>Nirvana was a Seattle-based rock band that gained popularity in the 1990s. They were founded by guitarist, singer, and songwriter Krist Novoselic (also known as &#8220;Noise&#8221;), bassist Kurt Cobain with help from Dave Grohl who joined after their first drummer left them due to school schedules; they finally found success when releasing Smells Like Teen Spirit off their debut album “Bleach” released back in 1989 which became an instant classic capturing both mainstream audiences but also creating something new called &#8216;alternative&#8217; music.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billie Eilish’s New Hair Color Might Be Signaling A New Era In Her Music.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/eLyOCNlUnPHTKduPWMZ..g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTY0MDtjZj13ZWJw/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GIl0zGNJyEkqeSCcXqlR1A--~B/aD0xMDAwO3c9MTUwMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/7c61bcf378da0fdedd4d01fe06140fb5" alt=""/><figcaption>Jesse Grant/Getty; Billie Eilish/Instagram</figcaption></figure>



<p>Billie Eilish just changed up her hair color once again. After going from black and neon green to platinum blonde to brunette, Billie has now returned to her roots and dyed her hair a deep jet black.<br><br>On Tuesday, the singer shared a photo of the new hue on Instagram. In the photo, Billie is sitting on an airplane, masked, with her dark hair loose and a pair of choppy, uneven bangs framing her pale blue eyes. Billie captioned the photo with a black square emoji. The photo received more than 9.8m likes. She also posted a selfie in space buns with the caption “Did you miss me?” on her stories. <br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="1024" src="/functions/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/billie-eilish-jet-black-hair-is-back-1024x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8051" srcset="/functions/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/billie-eilish-jet-black-hair-is-back-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, /functions/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/billie-eilish-jet-black-hair-is-back-300x300.jpg 300w, /functions/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/billie-eilish-jet-black-hair-is-back-150x150.jpg 150w, /functions/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/billie-eilish-jet-black-hair-is-back-768x768.jpg 768w, /functions/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/billie-eilish-jet-black-hair-is-back-75x75.jpg 75w, /functions/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/billie-eilish-jet-black-hair-is-back-750x750.jpg 750w, /functions/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/billie-eilish-jet-black-hair-is-back-1140x1140.jpg 1140w, /functions/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/billie-eilish-jet-black-hair-is-back.jpg 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CZdPEy2LGd8/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">billieeilish</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;she&#8217;s back.&#8221; The Grammy winner also commented on the post.<br><br>Her social media debut comes just days before the start of her <a href="/functions/billie-eilish-concert-dates-and-tickets-in-2022/">Happier Than Ever, The World Tour, which kicks off on Thursday in New Orleans</a>.</p>



<p><br><br>Eilish’s most recent hair switch-up comes just two months after she went brunette, ditching the platinum blond look synonymous with her “Happier Than Ever” album cycle.</p>



<p>When the superstar debuted her lighter locks on Instagram last March, the photo racked up a record-setting one million likes in just six minutes.</p>



<p>But dark hair’s nothing new for Eilish; prior to going platinum, she sported a striking black-and-green ‘do for well over a year. The musicians also tried out shades ranging from blue to red in the past.<br><br>Her distinctive hairstyles don&#8217;t define her. Eilish told in an interview with ELLE in October.<br><br>&#8220;The other day, I posted a video from when I had green hair, and I saw people go, &#8216;I miss this Billie, the green-haired Billie,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;I&#8217;m still the same person. I&#8217;m not just different Barbies with different heads.&#8221;<br><br>Eilish is set to headline this year&#8217;s Coachella music festival alongside <a href="/functions/harry-styles-live-concert-dates-and-ticket-prices/">Harry Styles</a> and Kanye West in April.</p>
