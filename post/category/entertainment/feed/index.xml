<p>Universal Pictures has released the final trailer for Jurassic World: Dominion, the latest sequel in the Jurassic Park franchise.</p>



<p>The sequel will take place in the present day, approximately four years since the events of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom.<em> </em>Owen Grady, Claire Dearing, Daniella Pineda as Dr. Zia, Omar Sy as Barry, and Laura Dern as Dr. Ellie Sattler are among the returning characters in &#8220;Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom.&#8221; Jeff Goldblum reprises his role as Ian Malcolm. Chris Pratt returns as Owen Grady. The film additionally features newcomers DeWanda Wise, Mamoudou Athie, Dichen Lachman, and Scott Haze among others.</p>



<p>The almost three-minute preview provides the necessary context for the finale film, which depicts humans and dinosaurs coexisting across the world. “Humans and dinosaurs can’t coexist. We created an ecological disaster,” Dern says in the preview.</p>



<p>“We not only lack dominion over nature, we’re subordinate to it,” Goldblum adds.</p>



<p>Colin Trevorrow, the film&#8217;s director, wrote the script with Emily Carmichael. Trevorrow,&nbsp;Steven Spielberg&nbsp;and Alexandra Derbyshire executive produce, with Frank Marshall and Patrick Crowley producing.</p>



<p>Jurassic World: Dominion will be released in movie theaters on June 10.</p>

<p>AMC has revealed an official release date for the upcoming sixth and final season of Better Call Saul, which had been teased earlier this week.</p>



<p>Better Call Saul season six, Part 1 will premiere on April 18 at 9 p.m. ET on AMC and AMC Plus with seven episodes. That evening, two episodes will be available, with additional installments airing every week. The second half of the season will air this summer on July 11.</p>



<p>Additionally, the company unveiled a first-look image from the upcoming season, which sees Bob Odenkirk in his role as the titular attorney.</p>



<p>Before the start of season five, AMC announced that Better Call Saul was renewed for a 10-episode final run in January 2020. Season six was originally scheduled to air in 2021, but it has been delayed due to the COVID-19 epidemic.</p>



<p>The final season of Better Call Saul features several other names, including Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman. It also stars Rhea Seehorn as Kim, Jonathan Banks as Mike, Giancarlo Esposito as Gus, Michael Mando as Nacho, Tony Dalton as Lalo, and many more.</p>



<p>“In my eyes, this is our most ambitious, surprising, and, yes, heartbreaking season,” co-creator and showrunner Peter Gould said in a statement on Thursday. “Even under incredibly challenging circumstances, the whole&nbsp;<em>Saul</em>&nbsp;team — writers, cast, producers, directors, and crew — have outdone themselves. I couldn’t be more excited to share what we’ve accomplished together.”</p>

<p>Ryan Reynolds&nbsp;teams up with&nbsp;<em>Free Guy</em>&nbsp;director Shawn Levy for his next sci-fi action&nbsp;Netflix&nbsp;film.</p>



<p>Netflix has revealed the teaser for Reynolds&#8217; time-traveling movie, in which his older self travels back to his younger self to assist him to save the world. Netflix’s synopsis of&nbsp;<em>The Adam Project</em>&nbsp;states that Adam Reed, played by Reynolds, “accidentally crash-landing in 2022,” enlists his 12-year-old self on a world-saving mission. The action-packed trailer features Jennifer Garner as Adam&#8217;s mother and Mark Ruffalo as his father.</p>



<p>The series follows 2050 Adam to help him repair his crash-landed ship. Reynolds told&nbsp;<em>Vanity Fair</em>, “The humor that Adam uses in the movie echoes certain aspects of my own life, which is that it’s a defense mechanism. It’s a defense mechanism from allowing anything in and trying to deflect. And of course, part of the journey that he’s on is to lower that shield.”</p>



<p>On Netflix on March 11, the Adam Project will premiere.</p>

<p>Gary Bowser, a member of the hacking group Team Xecuter, has been sentenced to 40 months in prison by a US federal court for pirating activity with Nintendo&#8217;s games and consoles.</p>



<p>Bowser will have to pay $10 million USD to Nintendo as part of an earlier settlement, and another $4.5 million USD in reparations, on top of his current sentence of more than three years. According to the Department of Justice&#8217;s statement, though, Bowser&#8217;s damages are expected to be in excess of $65 million USD.</p>



<p>“This piracy scheme is estimated to have caused more than $65 million [USD] in losses to video game companies,” said U.S. Attorney Nick Brown. “But the damage goes beyond these businesses, harming video game developers and the small, creative studios whose products and hard work is essentially stolen when games are pirated.”</p>



<p>“This is not a victimless crime,” added special agent Robert Hammer. “The leaders of this multimillion-dollar scheme are responsible for diverting money from creative professionals who have worked hard to provide unique products and experiences.”</p>

<p>Following a news story about Billie Eilish stopping a show to assist a fan, Kanye West now wants the 20-year-old singer to apologize to Travis Scott. During a stop for <a href="/functions/billie-eilish-concert-dates-and-tickets-in-2022/">Eilish&#8217;s Happier Than Ever World Tour,</a> an instance occurred at Atlanta&#8217;s State Farm Arena. The performance was momentarily halted for a fan in need of an inhaler, and the artist stated, &#8220;I wait for the people to be okay before I keep going.&#8221;</p>



<p>Soon after, many media sources began reporting on the comment&#8217;s apparent target towards Travis Scott, referencing the Astroworld Festival accident.</p>



<p>Kanye West took to Instagram to post a screenshot of a headline, along with a caption. “COME ON BILLIE WE LOVE YOU PLEASE APOLOGIZE TO TRAV AND TO THE FAMILIES OF THE PEOPLE WHO LOST THEIR LIVES NO ONE INTENDED THIS TO HAPPEN TRAV DIDN’T HAVE ANY IDEA OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING WHEN HE WAS ON STAGE AND WAS VERY HURT BY WHAT HAPPENED.”</p>



<p>Ye went on to reveal that Travis Scott will be with him at&nbsp;Coachella, where the two are headlining, and requested an apology before his performance. “YES TRAV WILL BE WITH ME AT COACHELLA BUT NOW I NEED BILLIE TO APOLOGIZE BEFORE I PERFORM.”</p>



<p>After the comments were made, it was revealed that Billie Eilish did not write them toward Travis. She has since added to Ye&#8217;s Instagram post, stating that she was not directed her words toward him. “Literally never said a thing about Travis. Was just helping a fan.”</p>

<p>Snoop Dogg has acquired the legendary record label Death Row. Snoop has cemented his status as an entertainment legend and hip-hop luminary by broadening his empire while sealing the acquisition of the label that launched him. MNRK Music Group formerly owned Death Row Records. In a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220209006117/en/Entertainment-Icon-Snoop-Dogg-Acquires-Death-Row-Records-Brand-from-Blackstone-Controlled-MNRK-Music-Group" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement</a>, Snoop spoke of the deal saying,</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“I am thrilled and appreciative of the opportunity to acquire the iconic and culturally significant Death Row Records brand, which has immense untapped future value. It feels good to have ownership of the label I was part of at the beginning of my career and as one of the founding members. This is an extremely meaningful moment for me. I would like to personally thank the teams at Blackstone, MNRK and especially David Kestnbaum, who worked collaboratively with me over several months to make this exciting homecoming a reality. I’m looking forward to building the next chapter of Death Row Records.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Suge Knight, Dr. Dre, and other prominent figures in the music industry launched Death Row Records in the early 1990s. Dr. Dre&#8217;s The Chronic and Snoop Dogg&#8217;s Doggystyle are just a few of the history-making hip-hop albums recorded at this facility, which also hosted such classics as Tupac Shakur&#8217;s All Eyez on Me, Dr. Dre&#8217;s The Chronic, and Snoop Dogg&#8217;s own Doggystyle mixtape. However, in 2006, Death Row filed for bankruptcy and went through a succession of owners before being acquired by toy company Hasbro.</p>



<p>This is a significant accomplishment for Snoop Dogg, who lamented in December of last year that he didn&#8217;t get the chance to buy Death Row Records when he had the opportunity. It appears that Snoop has achieved his ambition and attracted the attention of those in the business, with Kanye West praising it as the best example of &#8220;Black Future Month.&#8221;</p>

<p>You probably remember watching cartoons as a kid, and how innocent and carefree they were. But have you ever gone back and rewatched them as an adult? If so, you&#8217;ll know that a lot of classic cartoon episodes had some pretty &#8216;adult moments&#8217; that you totally missed the first time around. <br><br>Here are 11 examples of classic cartoons with &#8216;adult moments&#8217; that will make you laugh, cringe, and question everything you thought you knew about your childhood favorites.<br></p>

<p>When Prince Charming arrives at the tower where Fiona is held captive, he discovers the Wolf instead of the princess. The character from the classic fairy tale, Little Red Riding Hood, appears to be entertaining himself by reading an interesting magazine, Pork Illustrated, a play on Sports Illustrated.</p>
</div>

<p>Sponge Bob watches a TV show in which an actinia dances to sensual music in one of the episodes. The presentation on the screen, based on Bob&#8217;s emotion, is not intended for children. It&#8217;s no coincidence that as soon as Gary walks into the room, he abruptly changes to the sports station.</p>



<p>This wasn&#8217;t only a fantasy made by cartoonists, though. Actinias and sponges sometimes have a symbiotic relationship. However, it is better to tell children about it in a less offensive manner.</p>

<p>Two girls (Mia and Tia) drive up to Lightning McQueen during an after-race photograph with the winners. They introduce themselves as big fans of the racer and suddenly hoist themselves up on their wheels, displaying their &#8220;high beams&#8221; to the racer. This was designed to resemble how some girls flash rock stars at concerts by lifting up their T-shirts.</p>

<p>On a date with Meg, Hercules shares his impression of the play they both watched recently. “And then that, that play, that, that, that Oedipus thing. Man, I thought I had problems.” It’s unclear to kids why Meg is laughing at this joke, while adults familiar with Greek mythology catch the irony.<br><br>King Oedipus killed his father and married his mother, oblivious that they were his parents. That is why Hercules claims that his problems are little compared to the trials of poor Oedipus.</p>

<p>Daffy Duck is bored at the movies in one of the cartoon series&#8217; episodes, so he begins to browse through a suspiciously named magazine.</p>

<p>In a children&#8217;s animation, there&#8217;s another not-suitable-for-kids incident. In the scene where Vanellope enters a Disney princess&#8217;s room, the princesses demonstrate their readiness to defend their domain from an intruder. Cinderella is the one who becomes enraged, breaking her shoe in the same way that men shatter bottles in bars during brawls, resulting in a homemade shiv.</p>

<p>This animation contains a great adult joke. Anna has an odd reaction when Kristoff appears in front of her all dressed up, reminding her that he only put it on for an hour. &#8220;I prefer you in leather anyway,&#8221; she says as she kisses her boyfriend and strokes his hair. Kristoff feels embarrassed by these remarks, and he grins stupidly.</p>

<p>When Judy and Nick go to the nudist club, the poor bunny is uncomfortable and doesn&#8217;t know where to hide her eyes. Of course, that&#8217;s exactly the response the cunning fox was looking for.</p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-buzzeditor-list-item"><h3 class="be-list-item-title"><span style="color:;background-color:;border-color:" class="be-list-item-number">9</span> <span style="color:;background-color:;border-color:" class="be-list-item-text">Toy Story</span></h3>

<p>In the first part of the film, Andy&#8217;s favorite toy, Woody, advises his companions not to be concerned about Andy&#8217;s birthday and new gifts. All of the toys do not share Woody&#8217;s calm demeanor. Mr. Potato Head expresses his disapproval of Woody&#8217;s viewpoint. When Slinky defends Woody, Mr. Potato Head moves his lips behind his back, thereby labeling Slinky a &#8220;butt kisser.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/functions/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/11-times-cartoons-had-adult-moments-that-you-totally-missed-as-a-kid-4.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption><a href="https://www.pixar.com/feature-films/toy-story" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">©&nbsp;Toy Story / Disney / Pixar</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>The story&#8217;s first half turned out to be full of mature jokes. Bo Peep thanks Woody for rescuing her sheep at the start of the film. She says a curious phrase: “What do you say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?” In response to this, the sheriff laughs stupidly and says only one thing: “Oh, yes.”</p>
</div>

<p>When Jane draws Tarzan, she explains to her father what things she found to be unusual in this strange man and says, “And his eyes were intense and focused and…I’ve never seen such eyes.” Professor Porter notices his daughter’s feelings and jokes, “Should I leave you and the blackboard alone for a moment?”</p>

<p>&#8220;I was just in the pool,&#8221; the embarrassed monster replies after Wayne the Werewolf removes the invisible man&#8217;s swimming trunks. &#8221; The water is cold. Don&#8217;t judge&nbsp;on me!&#8221;</p>

<p>A makeup artist named gillianisme on TikTok is transforming herself into virtually any celebrity or recognizable character with brushes and shadows. She has transformed herself into the likes of Scarlett Johansson (2017), Scarlet Witch from Avengers Age Of Ultron; Kate Blanchett as Elizabeth I in &#8220;Into The Woods&#8221; &#8211; she even manages to make Anne Hathaway look good.</p>



<p>When people are alarmed by how easy it is to fake anything with digital means, like Photoshop, and despite the fact that nobody can surprise anyone anymore because everyone knows this too. But this makeup artist shows us otherwise; he demonstrates how one could create an incredible false identity using more &#8220;analog&#8221; methods such as brushes for shadowing or mascara.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s enjoy some of the transformations this artist made possible with the strokes of brushes. Scroll down and enjoy!</p>
