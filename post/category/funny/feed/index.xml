<p>You probably remember watching cartoons as a kid, and how innocent and carefree they were. But have you ever gone back and rewatched them as an adult? If so, you&#8217;ll know that a lot of classic cartoon episodes had some pretty &#8216;adult moments&#8217; that you totally missed the first time around. <br><br>Here are 11 examples of classic cartoons with &#8216;adult moments&#8217; that will make you laugh, cringe, and question everything you thought you knew about your childhood favorites.<br></p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/functions/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/11-times-cartoons-had-adult-moments-that-you-totally-missed-as-a-kid-11.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption><a href="https://www.dreamworks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">©&nbsp;Shrek 2 / DreamWorks Animation</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>When Prince Charming arrives at the tower where Fiona is held captive, he discovers the Wolf instead of the princess. The character from the classic fairy tale, Little Red Riding Hood, appears to be entertaining himself by reading an interesting magazine, Pork Illustrated, a play on Sports Illustrated.</p>
</div>

<p>Sponge Bob watches a TV show in which an actinia dances to sensual music in one of the episodes. The presentation on the screen, based on Bob&#8217;s emotion, is not intended for children. It&#8217;s no coincidence that as soon as Gary walks into the room, he abruptly changes to the sports station.</p>



<p>This wasn&#8217;t only a fantasy made by cartoonists, though. Actinias and sponges sometimes have a symbiotic relationship. However, it is better to tell children about it in a less offensive manner.</p>

<p>Two girls (Mia and Tia) drive up to Lightning McQueen during an after-race photograph with the winners. They introduce themselves as big fans of the racer and suddenly hoist themselves up on their wheels, displaying their &#8220;high beams&#8221; to the racer. This was designed to resemble how some girls flash rock stars at concerts by lifting up their T-shirts.</p>
</div>

<p>On a date with Meg, Hercules shares his impression of the play they both watched recently. “And then that, that play, that, that, that Oedipus thing. Man, I thought I had problems.” It’s unclear to kids why Meg is laughing at this joke, while adults familiar with Greek mythology catch the irony.<br><br>King Oedipus killed his father and married his mother, oblivious that they were his parents. That is why Hercules claims that his problems are little compared to the trials of poor Oedipus.</p>

<p>Daffy Duck is bored at the movies in one of the cartoon series&#8217; episodes, so he begins to browse through a suspiciously named magazine.</p>

<p>In a children&#8217;s animation, there&#8217;s another not-suitable-for-kids incident. In the scene where Vanellope enters a Disney princess&#8217;s room, the princesses demonstrate their readiness to defend their domain from an intruder. Cinderella is the one who becomes enraged, breaking her shoe in the same way that men shatter bottles in bars during brawls, resulting in a homemade shiv.</p>

<p>This animation contains a great adult joke. Anna has an odd reaction when Kristoff appears in front of her all dressed up, reminding her that he only put it on for an hour. &#8220;I prefer you in leather anyway,&#8221; she says as she kisses her boyfriend and strokes his hair. Kristoff feels embarrassed by these remarks, and he grins stupidly.</p>

<p>When Judy and Nick go to the nudist club, the poor bunny is uncomfortable and doesn&#8217;t know where to hide her eyes. Of course, that&#8217;s exactly the response the cunning fox was looking for.</p>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-buzzeditor-list-item"><h3 class="be-list-item-title"><span style="color:;background-color:;border-color:" class="be-list-item-number">9</span> <span style="color:;background-color:;border-color:" class="be-list-item-text">Toy Story</span></h3>

<p>In the first part of the film, Andy&#8217;s favorite toy, Woody, advises his companions not to be concerned about Andy&#8217;s birthday and new gifts. All of the toys do not share Woody&#8217;s calm demeanor. Mr. Potato Head expresses his disapproval of Woody&#8217;s viewpoint. When Slinky defends Woody, Mr. Potato Head moves his lips behind his back, thereby labeling Slinky a &#8220;butt kisser.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/functions/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/11-times-cartoons-had-adult-moments-that-you-totally-missed-as-a-kid-4.jpg" alt=""/><figcaption><a href="https://www.pixar.com/feature-films/toy-story" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">©&nbsp;Toy Story / Disney / Pixar</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>The story&#8217;s first half turned out to be full of mature jokes. Bo Peep thanks Woody for rescuing her sheep at the start of the film. She says a curious phrase: “What do you say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?” In response to this, the sheriff laughs stupidly and says only one thing: “Oh, yes.”</p>

<p>When Jane draws Tarzan, she explains to her father what things she found to be unusual in this strange man and says, “And his eyes were intense and focused and…I’ve never seen such eyes.” Professor Porter notices his daughter’s feelings and jokes, “Should I leave you and the blackboard alone for a moment?”</p>

<p>&#8220;I was just in the pool,&#8221; the embarrassed monster replies after Wayne the Werewolf removes the invisible man&#8217;s swimming trunks. &#8221; The water is cold. Don&#8217;t judge&nbsp;on me!&#8221;</p>

We must all agree that life without technology now appears to be nearly impossible. Though technology makes life easier, it is also the source of a slew of social problems, the most prominent of which is smartphone addiction.</p>

<p>Scrolling down to check out the dark drawings for yourself. Though these comics may appear to be funny, the issues they address are concerning to many of us, and hopefully, you will not find yourself in these dark images.</p>

<p>Dark humor is adored by many comic book fans. People crave the excitement and twists that come with reading comic books, especially in the form of dark humor.</p>
<p>Many artists, on the other hand, are averse to doing things that are both complicated and paradoxical. Alan, a well-known artist, has a unique method of crafting plots and can produce an extensive story in numerous panels, which people adore.</p>
<p>Alan is a part-time artist in the United States who also works as a web developer. Alan explained that fan art, including video game characters, motivated him to pursue digital art. But, recognizing that the joy of creating comics might be far greater, the artist began to think about his own artistic ideas and produced a story.</p>
<p>The artist has 1,100 Instagram followers and lately begun posting on social media under the name Combo Deluxe. Their art is funny and has a touch of black humor, all while making people laugh and enjoy themselves.</p>
<p>We believe Alan is deserving of more followers based on his work. Alan&#8217;s art is always enjoyable to look at.</p>

<h4></h4>



<p>Sometimes somebody takes a photograph so perfectly timed that it can never be recreated, no matter how hard you try. Some of these photos are so perfect that you can’t help but wonder whether the photographers knew about the accident before it even happened. But lets not get carried away with conspiracy theories. Not all photographers are stalkers and sociopaths with diabolical plans.</p>
<p>If you want to see how it looks like before disaster strikes, you’re at the right place. We have listed 25 funny photos right before disaster strikes.</p>
<p>Keep scrolling and have fun, folks.</p>

<p>What can someone do with a set of great Photoshop skills? Yes, they can create beautiful digital art and edit amazing photos. But can they travel back in time? In this case, it seems like they can!</p>
<p>Conor Nickerson, a Montreal-based photographer, used Photoshop to travel back in time to hang out with his younger self. Tho it is not in any scientific way, Conor photoshopped his present self into his childhood photos from 1997-2005 and as you can see, he’s quite successful to do so.</p>
<p>While looking at some old photos Conor imagined how it would be like to be in them with his present self. He wasted no more time, grabbed his old hats and tees, and went for it. But obviously going back in time is a challenging task whether it is in a scientific way or in photoshop.</p>
<p>“It involved a lot of blurring, sharpening, and noise to try to get it to look like an older photo,” says Conor about the challenge he faced during the project. So why are we wasting our time? Let&#8217;s check out the amazing project.</p>

<h4 id="is-your-pet-normal"><strong>Is your pet normal?</strong></h4>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s important to understand the commitment you&#8217;re making when you want to welcome a pet into your house and make them a new family member. Pets are a big responsibility, and you should treat them as if they were your child. There&#8217;s a lot that can go wrong, and you&#8217;ll be held responsible if it does. All animals, whether they are a dog, a cat, or even a bunny, require attention, time, and affection.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you have a furry buddy, you should consider their safety and well-being as a first priority. Pet owners will go to any lengths to protect their little babies. On a cold night, they would offer them blankets, food, time, play with them, and even make them sleep in their bed with them! Keeping an eye on them is always a good idea because anything scary can happen to them in a fraction of a second. Pets are fragile, and despite their best efforts, they might find themselves in tough and dangerous situations. As a result, it is the owner&#8217;s job and responsibility to keep an eye on their pet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our partners, on the other hand, can sometimes catch us off guard. They have the ability to send us into panic mode, but we don&#8217;t know if this is done intentionally or unintentionally! That is a puzzle. There&#8217;s still no reason to worry your owners like that, but I doubt their pets would ever understand! Animals may do anything to scare you away, from applying tomato paste (which looks like blood) to sleeping like they&#8217;re dead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few of those photographs that will make you look again, if not three times, to fully realize what is going on. Scroll down and have a good time!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A twitter user by the name of _sumola_(https://twitter.com/_sumola_) posts images of her cat, and one of the photos she shared appeared to have the cat&#8217;s tail sliced off. Yikes! This lady resides in the city of Ottawa, Ontario. Void is her black cat, and he is basically Tally&#8217;s (Sumola&#8217;s roommate) cat. &#8220;As Void is the darkest, he prefers to act very secretive,&#8221; Tally stated in an interview. He is, however, a giant dork. To ask for pats, he will reach out his paw (nails included on occasion) and pet you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tally also believes that giving its owner a heart attack is both necessary and enjoyable for two reasons. &#8220;First, they&#8217;re little nasty gremlins who thrive on suffering, and second, they like the way you treat them afterward, Tallys explains.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;He prefers to sit in the darkest of spots, whether it my laundry basket, beneath the bed, bookcase, or closet,&#8221; said Void, who is totally black. &#8220;Other than him,&#8221; Tally added sarcastically, Void wants to make sure no other demons can assault her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In her conversation, Tally also brings up the wonderful concept of adoption. Adoption is a lovely gesture that has numerous advantages, not only for the animals but also for the shelters. &#8220;Don&#8217;t shop, adopt!&#8221; &#8220;Yes, Void&#8217;s name was UnaVoidable,&#8221; she added. That bit had to happen, right?&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Pets provide us with a great deal of joy and happiness. All pet owners will be able to relate to this statement. Pets can assist in the reduction of stress. They are indeed magical, since they have the ability to lighten our gloomy days simply by cuddling us. They are extremely loyal and devoted. They will make a lovely companion for you. It is vital to love them, but loving them can sometimes bring difficulties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Megan MacCutcheon, a psychologist, believes that owning a pet poses a constant risk of stress. &#8220;Things include adjusting to owning a new pet, training a pet, acquainting new pets with existing pets, introducing pets and children, and finding solutions to varied obligations such as pet sitting, dog walking, and so on.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When you have a pet and love them wholeheartedly, it&#8217;s impossible to face the fact that they will die one day. And you&#8217;ll either have to do without them or they&#8217;ll have to do without you. This is such a sad concept. &#8220;While many pets appear to be eternally young, they do grow older, their health deteriorates, and we are burdened with even more obligations as we deal with the added chores and expectations that come with caring for an aged or sick animal.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you have a pet, you treat them as if they were your child, and even a scratch on their body causes you to get concerned. Because that is the nature of the pet-owner relationship. You must prioritize their health over your own and keep an eye on them at all times. However, one must accept the fact that they will not live indefinitely. And seeing their health deteriorate and them become ill is undoubtedly a terrible experience for the owners. Megan refers to it as &#8220;pet owner anxiety.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pet owners bear a great deal of duty, which comes with the anxiety of fulfilling that commitment. It can also be highly stressful. Seeing your pets in agony can create a great deal of anxiety and stress. Your dogs suffering from a sickness and your decisions to euthanize them, their lives dependent on you and your decisions, all of these scenarios can be quite stressful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, this is only true for persons who regard their dogs to be members of their family. There are those who consider their pets to be nothing more than pets and have no emotional attachment to them. They are unconcerned about them. When you become emotionally attached to your pet, everything else fades into the background. And because your sentiments are involved, you don&#8217;t want to be practical all of the time</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And now that we&#8217;ve reached the end, you may put your panic mode to rest. The point of this post was to show how much we love our dogs and how terrified we would be if something bad happened to them! It was frightening at first, but it turned out to be hilarious!</span></p>
