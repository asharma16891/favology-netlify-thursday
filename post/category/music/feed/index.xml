<p>The son of Death Row Records founder Suge Knight has spoken about Snoop Dogg’s recent acquisition of the famed record label.</p>



<p>Speaking to&nbsp;<em>TMZ</em>, Suge Jacob Knight said that “it’s a victory for the West Coast” and that he is happy just like everyone else. “I’m just happy it’s coming back to the West Coast,” he said. “And now, hopefully we can start winning because we lost Nipsey [Hussle], we lost Kobe [Bryant] — I mean, we lost a lot of things even after my dad went to jail, we started losing.”</p>



<p>He revealed that his father is not “punching the air” with Snoop’s new ownership of his record label, clarifying that they understand the business, “Eazy-E and my pops was cool. Snoop and my pops is cool. And other people are cool in the industry, people just don’t understand that.”</p>



<p>Snoop Dogg, who acquired Death Row Records from MNRK Music Group, recently said, “I am thrilled and appreciative of the opportunity to acquire the iconic and culturally significant Death Row Records brand, which has immense untapped future value. It feels good to have ownership of the label I was part of at the beginning of my career and as one of the founding members. This is an extremely meaningful moment for me.”</p>

<p>Following a news story about Billie Eilish stopping a show to assist a fan, Kanye West now wants the 20-year-old singer to apologize to Travis Scott. During a stop for <a href="/functions/billie-eilish-concert-dates-and-tickets-in-2022/">Eilish&#8217;s Happier Than Ever World Tour,</a> an instance occurred at Atlanta&#8217;s State Farm Arena. The performance was momentarily halted for a fan in need of an inhaler, and the artist stated, &#8220;I wait for the people to be okay before I keep going.&#8221;</p>



<p>Soon after, many media sources began reporting on the comment&#8217;s apparent target towards Travis Scott, referencing the Astroworld Festival accident.</p>



<p>Kanye West took to Instagram to post a screenshot of a headline, along with a caption. “COME ON BILLIE WE LOVE YOU PLEASE APOLOGIZE TO TRAV AND TO THE FAMILIES OF THE PEOPLE WHO LOST THEIR LIVES NO ONE INTENDED THIS TO HAPPEN TRAV DIDN’T HAVE ANY IDEA OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING WHEN HE WAS ON STAGE AND WAS VERY HURT BY WHAT HAPPENED.”</p>



<p>Ye went on to reveal that Travis Scott will be with him at&nbsp;Coachella, where the two are headlining, and requested an apology before his performance. “YES TRAV WILL BE WITH ME AT COACHELLA BUT NOW I NEED BILLIE TO APOLOGIZE BEFORE I PERFORM.”</p>



<p>After the comments were made, it was revealed that Billie Eilish did not write them toward Travis. She has since added to Ye&#8217;s Instagram post, stating that she was not directed her words toward him. “Literally never said a thing about Travis. Was just helping a fan.”</p>

<p><a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/kanye-west">Kanye West</a>, the man who is now better known as just Ye has revealed his latest whip. Some have drawn comparisons between this vehicle to Batman’s Batmobile but one thing is certain &#8211; for Kanye, it&#8217;s simply &#8220;the Yemobile.&#8221;</p>



<p>The name of the car may be a mouthful, but it&#8217;s no stranger to making moves. Just last year the DONDA rapper was auctioning off six cars from his Wyoming collection which totaled over $434 800 USD! After reports surfaced saying that he sold one of these custom Ripsaw EV2 tanks for nearly half a million dollars in Diesel Brothers country &#8211; it seems like this high-profile artist has added yet another supercar onto his fleet: A modified BAC Mono named &#8220;Yemobile.&#8221;</p>



<p>The company specializes in making road-legal sports vehicles that only have 12 dealership agreements across four continents. Their first generation ended at the end of 2020, but they were able to come out with a new model soon after just like how we saw last year when there was also an update for their second version which went on sale around 2021 timeframes. </p>



<p>Expecting to be the second-generation BAC Mono, this car features a lightweight body and an aerodynamic interior. With an engine that delivers 332 horsepower for Mountune powered by VE Technology Group Inc., it can reach speeds up to 60 mph in just 2.7 seconds! The starting price is approximately USD 220k.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at the “Yemobile” below.</p>

King Push has released the video for the track just hours after it was released.

<p>Snoop Dogg has acquired the legendary record label Death Row. Snoop has cemented his status as an entertainment legend and hip-hop luminary by broadening his empire while sealing the acquisition of the label that launched him. MNRK Music Group formerly owned Death Row Records. In a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220209006117/en/Entertainment-Icon-Snoop-Dogg-Acquires-Death-Row-Records-Brand-from-Blackstone-Controlled-MNRK-Music-Group" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement</a>, Snoop spoke of the deal saying,</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“I am thrilled and appreciative of the opportunity to acquire the iconic and culturally significant Death Row Records brand, which has immense untapped future value. It feels good to have ownership of the label I was part of at the beginning of my career and as one of the founding members. This is an extremely meaningful moment for me. I would like to personally thank the teams at Blackstone, MNRK and especially David Kestnbaum, who worked collaboratively with me over several months to make this exciting homecoming a reality. I’m looking forward to building the next chapter of Death Row Records.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Suge Knight, Dr. Dre, and other prominent figures in the music industry launched Death Row Records in the early 1990s. Dr. Dre&#8217;s The Chronic and Snoop Dogg&#8217;s Doggystyle are just a few of the history-making hip-hop albums recorded at this facility, which also hosted such classics as Tupac Shakur&#8217;s All Eyez on Me, Dr. Dre&#8217;s The Chronic, and Snoop Dogg&#8217;s own Doggystyle mixtape. However, in 2006, Death Row filed for bankruptcy and went through a succession of owners before being acquired by toy company Hasbro.</p>



<p>This is a significant accomplishment for Snoop Dogg, who lamented in December of last year that he didn&#8217;t get the chance to buy Death Row Records when he had the opportunity. It appears that Snoop has achieved his ambition and attracted the attention of those in the business, with Kanye West praising it as the best example of &#8220;Black Future Month.&#8221;</p>
